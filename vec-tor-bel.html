        <!-- <h2>Press Release</h2> -->
        <p>
          False Flag is proud to present&nbsp;<em>Vec Tor Bel</em>&nbsp;from
          NonCoreProjector—a collective formed by Rollo Carpenter, Jack Colton,
          Elias Jarzombek, and John O’Connor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Projected onto the gallery’s main wall is a continually-evolving
          series of translucent videos, overlaid with dynamic colored graphs.
          The visual content is produced by Cleverbot, a chatbot developed by
          Rollo Carpenter, driven by an artificial intelligence algorithm. Each
          day initiates a new conversation: Cleverbot pulls a headline from the
          morning’s news, searches that phrase on YouTube, plays the resulting
          video, and reads aloud the first comment - which becomes the initial
          node on a projected graph. Cleverbot responds to this initial comment,
          then uses the response for a subsequent search, repeating this cycle
          through the end of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The average color of each video is distilled into a transparent
          filter, creating a haze of colored fields. While the videos are
          largely silent, their same originating phrases are also searched for
          on a found-sound database; the results are correlatively diffused,
          stretched, and compressed into the soundtrack.&nbsp;The emotional
          intensity of the language dictates the substance, pace and movements
          of the projection: Cleverbot’s AI algorithm analayzes then&nbsp;charts
          the emotional content of the scanned commentary through color, line
          type, and direction. Each day, O’Connor will use the initial news
          headline and Cleverbot’s final comment as the inspiration for a
          stylistically-diverse series of drawings: paranthetically documenting
          the flow and direction of the day's conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          NonCoreProjector conceives of this new piece as “a series of
          interruptions”: with each interaction, there is a re-direction or
          derailment, evoking increasingly-familiar cultural and political
          interruptions. Bringing together found footage,
          algorithmically-induced uncertainty, and appropriated human
          commentary,&nbsp;<em>Vec Tor Bel&nbsp;</em>portrays two
          ‘intelligences’ attempting to make sense of both one another and the
          world at large. In ways both fascinating and terrifying, the slippages
          that perpetually dislodge any emergent logic send us down a Dada-ist
          rabbit hole.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are parameters within which&nbsp;<em>Vec Tor Bel</em
          >&nbsp;operates, the collective forfeits a significant degree of
          agency, yielding unpredictable results. In the spirit of Bruce Conner,
          John Cage, and Yoko Ono, the moment-to-moment outcome cannot be
          anticipated. At once eerily humanistic and undeniably
          technological,&nbsp;<em>Vec Tor Bel</em>&nbsp;advances
          NonCoreProject’s investigation of the uncanny entities that hold
          growing sway over our lives - from the causes we embrace to the
          partners we choose.
