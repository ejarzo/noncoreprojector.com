          is an extended conversation between the chatbot Cleverbot and itself,
          continuously, for a month. The conversation will begin at the start of
          the exhibition and will be spoken audibly. The emotional content of
          the words spoken will be translated into an animated projection that
          will evolve in sync with the emergent mental state of the bot. A
          webcam will broadcast from the space via a 24-hour live feed on
          YouTube, so that viewers can eavesdrop at any time, day or night. “In
          essence, we’re forcing a robot to interrogate itself for an extreme
          duration. The emotional degree and intensity of each phrase spoken,
          and consequent reaction, will propel the projected ‘eye’ of the bot,
          as its emotive state changes. Where the conversation goes is
          completely out of our control.” (O’Connor)

          Cleverbot is possibly the most human chatbot ever created, and Rollo
          Carpenter—its creator—is a leader in linguistic artificial
          intelligence. He and it have been featured on the podcast Radiolab and
          discussed in Brian Christian’s book <em>The Most Human Human</em>.
          Carpenter invented Cleverbot over twenty years ago and taught it to
          speak as one would a human child: one word at a time. Cleverbot’s
          responses are not pre-programmed, but are derived from its memory of
          past conversations—it learns exclusively from human input, and when
          someone speaks to it, Cleverbot responds to those words by finding how
          a human being previously responded to those same words. Since
          launching on the web in 1997, the number of conversations it has had
          is immense. “Cleverbot is in a sense a conversational Wikipedia, using
          the thoughts of millions of people from the past. It’s always AI that
          decides what to say, not users themselves, and the number of
          interactions from which replies derive number approximately 400
          million. That’s, however, a tiny fraction of the approximately 10
          billion things that have ever been said to it.” (Carpenter)

          In this exhibition, the bot will be talking to itself, but because of
          its vast memory, the effect will be of ourselves, collectively,
          speaking to ourselves. “It occurred to us that this 24-hour stream is
          acting like a live broadcast of all of conversations being had
          simultaneously, as it is learning daily from the input of Cleverbot
          users around the world, and is indirectly broadcasting the inputs of
          those users. This conversation is not a closed feedback loop, but is
          actually getting input from Cleverbot users everywhere.” (Colton)
        </p>
        <p>
          The main organizational construct of the projection is of a roving
          eye—simultaneously the idea of the bot searching outside of itself,
          into the world, looking for patterns, and of us, looking into its
          brain as if through a peephole. The emotional intensity of the words
          the bot speaks will dictate the substance, pace and movements of the
          projection’s machinations.

          <em>verbolect</em> also draws inspiration from current AI innovations
          that allow computers to act more as humans do. At times, public
          experiments in this field have sparked fascination and alarm, as when
          Facebook chatbots reportedly began to speak their own invented
          language, unbeknownst to their creators. References in popular culture
          inform as well—the ominous uncanniness of AI entities such as Joshua
          in the film <em>War Games</em>, and HAL from
          <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, embody both our excitement and fear of
          truly intelligent machines. Relatedly, the ruthless binary quality of
          intrapersonal conversation is explored in Donald Barthelme’s short
          story “Game,” and non-verbally in Maria Abromovic’s durational piece
          “The Artist is Present.”
