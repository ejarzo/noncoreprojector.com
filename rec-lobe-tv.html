        <strong>CONCEPT>></strong> Rec Lobe TV maps the labyrinthine processes
        through which human experience is perceived and transformed - from
        observation through language - into a multi-sensory simulacrum that
        affects consequent behavior and beliefs. RLTV follows this chain
        reaction step-by-step, rendering the results visible, no matter how
        bizarre: from real-time accounts of local events and national news
        reporting, into the untethered time-space of the internet and AI
        intelligence. Like mapping a complex, multi-directional game of
        telephone, RLTV mirrors the process by which we come to believe what's
        real in the world, as direct observation of a singular phenomenon
        mutates through law enforcement, media, AI, stochastic stimuli, and
        storytelling into eerily uncanny phenomena. Like Joseph Heller wrote in
        Catch-22, “Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they aren't after
        you.”

        <strong>PRESS RELEASE EXCERPT>></strong> Bringing together real time
        events, collaged footage, global patterns of journalistic story-telling,
        chatbot AI, and appropriated human commentary, Rec Lobe TV portrays
        several 'intelligences' attempting to make sense of each other and the
        world at large. In ways both fascinating and terrifying, the slippages
        that perpetually dislodge any emergent logic send us down the rabbit
        hole. Each output (projection, graphs, media, web browsing) represents a
        specific method through which we, as human beings, attempt to understand
        the world via the media around us, and, simultaneously, how these same
        media cycles can confuse, obfuscate, and ultimately cause us to lose our
        senses of self. While there are parameters within which RLTV operates,
        our collective forfeits a significant degree of agency to the system we
        create, embracing the unpredictable at each step, as the
        moment-to-moment outcome cannot be anticipated. Simultaneously
        humanistic and technological, Rec LobeTV advances our investigation of
        the uncanny entities that shape our lives.
