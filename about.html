        NonCoreProjector is a collective of visual artists, technologists,
        scientists, and musicians experimenting with physical, biological,
        conceptual, and political data systems, along with human/AI symbiosis.
        We explore consequential relationships between spoken and written
        language and multisensory, visceral experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in the open dissemination of information, and source free
        online resources like WebAPIs, streaming/broadcasting services,
        newsfeeds, and chatbots. Therefore, our works embrace the unpredictable
        flow of misused technology, user comments, and glitches. We similarly
        utilize silence, both as a way to counter the highly processed media we
        investigate, and to center the unpredictable acoustics within diverse
        spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The systems we construct to generate visual and auditory content build
        slowly and incrementally, in a Rube Goldberg way. We are searching for
        patterns that link the past to the present and the human to the
        artificial. Our works investigate reciprocal relationships between
        brains, bodies, sensory stimuli, spaces and machines.
